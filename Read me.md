Exploratory Data Analysis
Prosper Loan 
In this project, I have analysed ProsperLoanData.csv file in order to find the most reliable people to lend money.
First of all, I started to understand the data and to do some wrangling. The data consists of 81 columns, this is why 
I chose which I really need. The projects have 5 different parts. It starts with wrangling section and then Univariante,
Bivariante and Multivariante parts are following. At the end I conclude my findings in conclusion part.
After doing some cleaning in the data I started to build some univariante visuals like Bar chart to find who are the
most borrower occupations or to find out average monthly income I used histogram and found that most people are earning
$5k in a month in general. 
In the bivariante section I analysed quantitive values and qualitative values and explore the data. I found that Credit
amounts were consistently increasing during the years. The most interesting part was that The doctors are most earned and 
students are least earned people. But surprisingly, there are no late payments on students, but Doctors had. I also 
analysed late payments and found that Analysts have the highest score in late payment.
I tried to look general view of the data in multivariante section. I divided my dataset into 2 parts 
(goodperformers and badperformers). These datasets helped me to understand which occupations have better
estimated returns and loss.
In conclusion I can say that I would recommend to lender to give money to goodperformer because they have high income
rate and lower risk on late payment. But, people as sellers, analyst and etc have high risk on back payment.
